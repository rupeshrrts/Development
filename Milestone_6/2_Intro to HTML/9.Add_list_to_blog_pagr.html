        Machine learning is a growing technology which enables computers to learn automatically from past data.
        Machine learning uses various algorithms for building mathematical models and making
        predictions using historical data or information. Currently, it is being used for
        various tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, email filtering, Facebook
        auto-tagging, recommender system, and many more.</p>

            <h1>Features of Machine Learning:</h1>
            <p>A Machine Learning system learns from historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it
                receives new data, predicts the output for it. The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount
                of data, as the huge
                amount of data helps to build a better model
                which predicts the output more accurately.

                <li>It can learn from past data and improve automatically.</li>
                <li>It is a data-driven technology.</li>
                <li>Machine learning is much similar to data mining as
                    it also deals with the huge amount of the data.</li>

            <h1>Classification of Machine Learning</h1>
            <p>
                Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample
                labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the
                output.
                </br>
            <p>

                The system creates a model using labeled data to understand the datasets and
                learn about each data, once the training and processing are done then we
                test the model by providing a sample data to check whether it is predicting the exact output or not.
                </br>
            </p>

            The goal of supervised learning is to map input data with the output
            data. The supervised learning is based on supervision, and it is the same as when a student learns things in
            the supervision of the teacher. The example of supervised learning is spam filtering.

            <H1>Unsupervised Learning</H1>
            <p>
                Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.
                </br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or
                categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of
                unsupervised
                learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.
